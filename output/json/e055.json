An asteroid could also act as a 23 for further space travel and exploration. The fact that an asteroid would have weaker 24 would allow easier movement of resources. These resources include 25 which could be used in space or on Earth, and 26 which could be consumed or used as a source of power. The mission could provide data on the history of our Sun and planets. It could also be good practice if there was a threat to Earth from a body from space.",
