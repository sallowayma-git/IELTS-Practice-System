        "content": "A Fun is becoming a tricky issue for ride designers. In order to increase excitement, they have been ramping up the accelerations to create the most dizzying forces possible. But getting it right is far from easy. Err on the side of caution and people won't bother with a second ride; go too far, however, and they may not be able to. Experts realise we are now at the limit of how much acceleration a human body can take, and designers are finding it hard to think up ways of keeping the public coming back for more. The problem is that true innovation has been lacking for a while, and fair-ground rides have become more about survival than actual enjoyment. So if our thrill-seeking bodies can really take no more, what's going to keep dragging us back to amusement parks? Creating something new and exciting, yet safe, is going to take some careful thought."
